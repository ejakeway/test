This is a test GitHub pages site. We would edit the content of this landing page directly in the README markdown file. This file cannot start with a heading of any level or else it will show up in the header of the entire webpage. That said, we can use headings from here down to break up text!

# h1 subheading test

Creating a single page of text is simple enough. I wonder how we would install subpages--may want to create a template? Would be able to reuse the Minima code base?
