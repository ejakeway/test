### Could we use an h2 heading?
This is a test GitHub pages site. We would edit the content of this landing page directly in the README markdown file. However, do not use an h1 level heading!

### Subheading

Creating a single page of text is simple enough. I wonder how we would install subpages--may want to create a template? Would be able to reuse the Minima code base?
